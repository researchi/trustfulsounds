# Beep Beep: How to Build Trust with Sound

Technology is becoming an increasingly invisible part of daily
live, likewise asking for embedded and unobtrusive, yet swift
and trustful interaction.  Voice is one modality that besides
content  transmission  offers  non-verbal  cues  that  influence
emotional perception.  While this allows to increase trust in
a system like digital assistants,  voice feedback is not well
suited  for  subtile  ubiquitous  interaction.   In  this  work  we
therefore focus on basic audio feedback and explore how audio
parameters like melody, pitch or tempo influence creation of
trust. We refer to related research in trust perception of voice,
and evaluate if the derived concepts can be universally applied
to simple sound patterns. Our study (n=39) shows significant
effects for the parameters melody and mode, while tendencies
were found for pitch and individual user preferences.   We
consider our findings to serve as basis for further research and
design of trustful user experiences.
